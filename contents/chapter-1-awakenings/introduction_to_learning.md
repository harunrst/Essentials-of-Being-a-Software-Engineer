# Introduction to Learning

Learning and discovery, this is how you build yourself. Unleash the perfect collaboration of your characteristics and external inputs... We all started learning once we were born; we learned to walk, we learned to succeed, we learned to love‚Ä¶ However, we didn‚Äôt always learn. We got distracted, we got desperate, we got weak and we gave up. This is mostly caused by 3 different parameters; **what**, **when** and **how**.

## What?

Commonly, people are losing themselves in the trends. They panic that they will stay behind, that they will be out of sight. Then they try to do something very quickly without proper information about what they are learning. They usually end up with some superficial knowledge that wouldn‚Äôt lead them anywhere.

Once you dedicate yourself to learning something, you must know the expected outcome from this learning experience. Think over the outcome; figure out the possible benefits to your existence, figure out the possible connections to your goals and figure out if it is interesting to you. If you start learning something rapidly with an instant enthusiasm -_you know you did it before_- you failed. Look at it from a wider perspective, see the big picture and evaluate it inside. Once you dedicate your time and effort to learning that makes sense to your aims; you will see how fast you are growing.

## When?

The age we are living at the moment is slightly harder comparing 500 years ago in terms of learning. To make the best car at the relative time; you should have known how to make the wheels and the body from wood, how to make seats from some fabric, where to find a pair of horses and a couple more things. I also include basic woodcutting, carpentry and knitting skills etc. And how would you do it now? It probably would take a lifetime to learn how to make the best car, also time is your enemy here considering the speed of the improvement of the current age. My point is that **the knowledge around us requires more background at this age**. When you say you want to learn x, it requires you to know y before it. This tree is getting bigger blazingly fast and you were born at the bottom of the tree.

This is why **before you jump on a branch, make sure you walked through the previous branches**. This is another reason that we got lost during the learning process, you must have the fundamentals for your topic. It could be anything including your character development as well. Try to be aware of the requirements of your learnings; consult people, make proper research and seek wisdom.

## How?

I am not the one who can tell you how to learn things, I am sure you already discovered your way of fitting the best in your mind. However, there are some essentials that I believe could improve your learning productivity.

- **Don‚Äôt rush**; think over twice about what you are about to learn, you wouldn‚Äôt want to waste your precious time. Discover outcomes, and prepare your resources and environment.
- **Be planned**; always have a next step, and know what you are doing. Don‚Äôt get lost among the resources and a pile of knowledge jumping one on another.
  - You will be branching to different topics during your journey, do not lose where you branched there.
  - If there is interesting new knowledge but it is huge to dive in, take note into your plan in upcoming steps.
  - Don‚Äôt miss anything that comes on your plate, but have an order for everything. Drink your soup first.
  - Make sure you have achievable steps to have a healthy state of mind. Break steps down into smaller pieces, achieve smaller but many.
- **Focus**; get away from distractions. The biggest distraction to you, is you sometimes. Many people are suffering from busy minds because they don‚Äôt have order in their life. We are having plenty of cautions in our lives such as paying the rent, calling our parents, completing the job assessment etc. They are all stacking up in your mind; you are thinking of them simultaneously. Especially when you didn‚Äôt do any of those, you are always like ‚Äúoh I got a lot of things to do‚Äù. **No, you don‚Äôt**. At that specific moment, you have nothing else to do but focus on your learning. Because you have not put those in order yet. They are just staying in your mind and disturbing you. And this is where you lose your focus.
  - Once you receive a notification from life, order it. ‚ÄúI am going to call my parents on wed at 8 pm‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am going to pay rent on Thu at 3 pm‚Äù etc. Order it and save it somewhere outside of your brain. Set a reminder, take a post-it note, or however you feel comfortable. And now, think again, what do you need to focus on at the moment?
  - Try to think broader about this, remember the endless notifications and a pile of things to do at your work. Once you receive something; don‚Äôt stop what you focused on right away, order what you just received if it is not urgent.
- **Read**; don‚Äôt stick with one or two resources. Keep your doors open, and read as many as you can. Discover different approaches and evaluate them for yourself. This way, you will open the way to recreate/improve from what you learned. **Remember that nobody knows the best, everybody exposes what they evaluated from what they have learned**. Besides;
  - The amount of knowledge we can learn is endless. Neither our life nor our energy is enough for it. However, at least you can learn enough to have some ideas about what it is and when you could use it. **Read enough to talk about it in case you don‚Äôt have time/opportunity to learn enough to practice it**.
- **Question**; question everything. Always dive deeper and ask why? Even if it is the most right or the most experienced person that gives you the knowledge, remember that it is their evaluation unless it is not a fact.
- **Practice**; natural selection exists in learning, don‚Äôt let things rot.
- **Explain**; try to explain to people what you learned. This is the best validation to understand if you actually learned something. You will see how hard it will be. You can do this even for very simple things, be communicative.

## Key Points of Learning

- üåé Bring light to people who are lost in learning! What are the key points of learning?

At the top of all these learning tips, everything starts with the mindset. Sometimes, knowledge brings some toxic thoughts. **Once you feel that you know a lot; be smart enough to have self-confidence, but don‚Äôt be such a fool to brag**. Be proud of your knowledge; be aware of it and use it to achieve more, but don‚Äôt be a bragger. **Even the wisest ones have passed from this world by seeking more wisdom, nobody was complete ever and never be**.
