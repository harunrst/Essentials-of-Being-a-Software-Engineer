# Introduction to Stress Management

It is all around our life. That wouldn't be wise to skip it and as you can say, it is easier said than done. What you will be reading will sound like stories and probably not gonna make any difference in your life if you don't think it over.

There will be a brief introduction to how stress works in our lives. However, there should be many more details about it. As stated above, this is an introduction.

You are stressing, it is a very humane reaction. **Stress doesn’t show up out of anything, it is your response to what happens**. You should always be able to control your responses to the external world you have around you. Once you got the stress; step back and look at the situation from a wider perspective. Try to think and focus on understanding the moment. Try to be aware of what is happening around you. Let’s phrase it this way;

Over time, you had been stressed 9842 times and it has passed. Maybe each time you asked yourself that “_Why did I stress this much?_”. When you were stressed, you made mistakes or caused hard times for yourself: remember the chef. You are treating bad to yourself by stressing over things that clearly will pass and preventing your maximum potential to be released. Stress pulls your self-confidence down, blinds you and demotivates you in the longer term. And the stress doesn’t stick to the moment, it affects your personal time after. Stress is one of the main reasons that you feel tired after work, you don’t want to do anything other than lie down. Stress is one of the lines between your work and life. It harms your creativity, excitement and joy in life. It makes your work and personal life unhealthy. However, you are not alone in this.

Think with me; abstract yourself from time, place and action. An infinite quiet emptiness. Now, look at the earth from this perspective. There had been and are, millions of people just like you. There had been and are, millions of companies just like you worked at and built. Even though you are a unique existence, you all had shared and are sharing the same experiences. Well, you are a bit luckier; the pyramid worker had been executed over a mistake, but you will not. You all had felt and are feeling the same feelings. Eventually, you all had been and are gone at some point.

Meaning that the stress you are having at work is nothing special. It will pass as it did before and you know that. You are only bringing pain to what all you have; **“now”**.

_“You don’t own the past or the future, you only own now in this life.”_ - _Marcus Aurelius_
