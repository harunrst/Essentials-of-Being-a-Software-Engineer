# Principles at Work

I hope you already are aware of some leadership principles that big whales are sharing and trying to make sure that every employee would understand them. This is no joke, there are some studies behind it. These companies are responsible for keeping businesses running all around the globe. Thus, they cannot let things happen in the chaos and out of order. If you think through those principles, they bring your work life some clarity and satisfaction. You already have those principles but maybe you never thought of them before. Awareness is crucial to bring them out in your lowest, hardest, stressed and demotivated times. Besides, you can find those online. I am going to mention **5** low-level principles. Let‚Äôs see what we have;

## Accountability

**Take responsibility for your actions and the consequences**. Your features are your babies; when they cry, they want their mama. It is always advised the shared knowledge but it is not always the case. There are times when people don‚Äôt know what to do with it, you should properly advise or take an action. **Don‚Äôt leave your baby until it can survive without you**.

It goes similarly with mistakes; be there and accept them. **Don‚Äôt bring up excuses, raise solutions**. Nobody is blaming you for making mistake, they are seeking a solution. Mistakes are the unavoidable realities of our daily life.

## Communication

1. **Strawberries**

   - Do you know what are the differences between you and strawberries? Strawberries are pretty delicious, they are from the Fragaria family. They are a product of some specific kind of plants and are born totally differently. Also, they cannot communicate with others. I have never seen a strawberry on my plate that said _‚ÄúAll my friends are living their life in a garden while I am sitting on this cold plate‚Äù_ or _‚ÄúHey folks, I have a lot on my plate; I am overloaded, I need some help here otherwise I am not going to be able to complete these on time‚Äù_.

   - It should not be hard to say it. You are being overloaded from time to time because they cannot follow up on everything you are doing. You should be communicative enough to let them know and relax. **It wouldn‚Äôt make you weak, it would make you a responsible person who cares about what is left on the plate when the deadline comes**. Don‚Äôt leave any strawberry on the plate, share it with others and enjoy it all together!

   - Oops, it seems like you run out of cream. But there are still some strawberries on the plate to eat. Is the cream a blocker? Yes, it damn is. Who has the cream or knows how to find cream? Don‚Äôt sit there and wait for the cream to come to you magically. Go find that person, **communicate and unblock yourself**!

   - That was delicious, wasn‚Äôt it? Maybe you should tell about the strawberries to someone? Present the strawberries to your colleagues. Tell them how to prepare it, how to eat it and how to enjoy it. However, your strawberry experience was not so smooth. You were blocked. **Why there was not enough cream?**

2. **The Chef**

   - It is a very important night, you have a food critic in your restaurant tonight. It is not a regular customer, everything must be at its best right? You prepared the menu very carefully, you let all your waiters know about it and thought that nothing could go wrong.

   - The critic is a woman around her 30s, brown-haired with a red hat with a long creamy coat. She is allergic to bay leaf and **peach**. This information is given to all waiters and the chef.

   - As she enters the restaurant; the waiter who was well-informed about her appearance recognizes her and helps her take the best seat in the restaurant. The waiter is so **smiley and frank**, she definitely feels at home and wants to come here again. It is very important to make people feel this way when they are around you. When you consider that you all spend the majority of your time together, small chats and cheerful faces make life more beautiful.

   - Another waiter with the menu gives the menu to her. Oops, the other waiter sees that it is not the correct menu. Instead of blaming someone; quickly approaches there, and replaces the menu she has with the correct one with an apology. After a while, back in the kitchen; the chef asks how did it happen? Figured that the waiter picked the wrong menu from the drawer. But the fix was very quick and successful thanks to your well-designed process. **What was the impact?** She didn‚Äôt mind it, it wasn‚Äôt a big issue for her and was quickly fixed. But the lesson learned, not all customers would be this kind. **To prevent it in the future**, they decided to change the cover colors of the menus and put them on different shelves with proper labels as they learned that **this is what the other successful restaurants are doing around** to avoid this mistake.

   - She prefers to eat a medium well steak with some sauce at the chef‚Äôs suggestion. You decided to make a delicious French Demi-glace sauce. The food is ready!

   - Before she uses the sauce on the steak, she wants to taste it plain. Oh, overcooked? It is not medium-well, it is medium-rare. She is not so happy about this because it doesn‚Äôt look professional at all. You cannot just change it now as well, you just need to make sure that it will not repeat. **How did you miss this?** You **didn‚Äôt validate** it. You **didn‚Äôt test** your steak with a meat thermometer. It was supposed to be between 65-69 degrees but it was 56. However, now you know that you must **test your product**. I wish you could ‚Äúhot‚Äùfix this time too :) You need to roll back the food and roll out the correct one but this would make you lose her. So, for now, you need to live with it. She is not happy but is still here for your food, maybe make her happy somehow?

   - You were stressed about this because you need her, you cannot lose her and need to make her happier. You decide to make her a dessert for the ending as surprising. It is a great idea, do your show! Meanwhile, she tried your sauce and she loved it.

   - The waiter brought the dessert to her, it looks delicious. She looks so happy, seems like you made it this time! She excitingly took a bite and got red right away. What is happening? You used peach in the dessert!? Oh, great. She asks for water and wears her coat by grumbling. There she goes, she is going to **end up in another restaurant** and review you pretty badly.

   - Well, you read the document carefully, and you knew her allergens thus you didn‚Äôt add a bay leaf from the original recipe to your sauce. Then you cooked the dessert under stress because of the steak. You could not control your stress and lost the customer. Anyways, it is not the end of the world but it could be the end of your career at this restaurant. However, the restaurant also should do a **postmortem** on this. The restaurant let the chef do the dessert under stress alone and didn‚Äôt validate it at all. It was so risky and cost them a very important customer and reputation.

### Metaphors to Communication

- üåé Do you have any metaphor to point out communication issues and good practices? Share with us!

## Impact

There is always a reason when you are doing a task. You do your best, you believe it has been an amazing feature. **How do you know?** The most of time, it has been ignored, it has just been believed. Your designer designed a dropdown menu that seems needed, you coded it perfectly and proudly released it. But, **are you measuring it?** How many times had it been clicked? How many times did it crush? When did the customer choose to click it? Did the customer satisfy the menu? Did the customer look for an alternative? Why didn‚Äôt the customer use enough as you expected?

**Measure it.** Did you ever see a hospital that let go of its patients after the surgery? (Probably did but I am on the happy path). There are the following examinations to see how your body reacts if there is any regression. If they tried something new, it also gives them insight that they could use it in the future. Follow up with your product; monitor its reactions, log its behaviors and **measure the impact**!

## Time Management and Priorities

Time is the most valuable currency that we are spending every moment. However, we underestimate its value significantly. Thinking of the idle time spent in a week is outrageous. How much time do you spend on socials each day? How much time do you spend on the screen idle when you are waiting for a meeting? How much time do you spend idly on your way somewhere just waiting? We think twice before spending our money but we are so cruel against time.

When you are planning your time, plan it wisely;

- **Every action you take in a day affects your upcoming actions**. Simply, do not eat before the gym otherwise you won't feel good. Do not get lost in socials before a meeting otherwise you will lose your focus. Do not prioritize no-brainers when you are at your finest. You know yourself better; remember your reactions to your daily actions and order them to maximize your productivity.
- Do not idle, time is an enemy of your brain. The more you use it, the more you fuel it.
- Always make sure of your current priorities. If you need to prepare for a meeting that is soon, move your focus to this. You can estimate how long some action would take but still give them a misestimation margin to prevent unexpected outcomes.
- Give yourself some time, and have some hobbies and passions other than work. This will motivate you more in work and life with the help of the satisfaction that is the joy of all.

## Determination

**Know what you want**. Talk about your desires and goals with self-confidence, and take action for them. Your ideas will change over time. It is understandable and smart of you. But don‚Äôt be lazy to quickly embrace them just because you have represented yourself differently. But don't mix it up with your promises to people, stay loyal to those. **Life is based on change, everything happens over a change**. However, some things are out of your control;

Don‚Äôt be okay with anything just because it is demanded from you. Your time and effort are valuable and try to maximize your productivity by focusing on what motivates and requires you the most. Of course, it is the happy scenario, there are times when you are doing other things that are required to move on. However, look at this on a wider scale; don‚Äôt be desperate to sacrifice your willingness in order to join a company, in order to make something leave you off, in order to avoid some situations. Take a step back and look if it really is your responsibility, is in your path to achieve or is an unrelated demand. You are being asked to do unrelated things because some people are just lazy or don‚Äôt know who to assign etc. Be aware of your environment, and be aware of how things work around you. Then take the proper action if possible, if not, question why? Find a solution to your discomfort or discuss it.

Once everything is on track, make sure you provide what you promised to yourself and the people. You are what you represent; you might not enjoy what you are doing at the moment but don‚Äôt be a pain for people. It also harms you, you are becoming someone you don‚Äôt like to be. At some point, you will realize that you changed in a bad way.
