# Introduction

As I say essential, it does not mean anything else. I am going to be super simple, clean and frank. This book could be helpful to you if you are;

- A software engineer or related positions
- A software engineer candidate
- A person

This is not a technical book, during the book; I am going to talk about mental states, basic habits, essential characteristics and many more. What I expect from you is to think it over because I want you to realize that whatever happens in your IT life can be easily pointed out by **awareness**. At the end of this book, I expect you to have a **good sense of awareness** about what is happening in your life and work. I want to encourage you to develop the consciousness to have your awarenesses.
